## 💡 The Idea

You control two characters at the same time, but their movements are mirrored.

Go left and one walks left, the other walks right. It sounds simple until you realize every single move affects both of them at once. The whole game is about learning to think in reverse and coordinate two brains with one pair of hands.

## 🎮 How It Works

Same keys. Same moment. Opposite directions.

| Input | Character A 🔵 | Character B 🔴 |
|---|---|---|
| ← Left | Moves left | Moves **right** |
| → Right | Moves right | Moves **left** |
| ↑ Jump | Jumps | Crouches |
| ↓ Crouch | Crouches | Jumps |

Movement is flipped. That's the whole mechanic, and it's enough.

**The rules are simple:**
- Both characters always move together, no individual control
- If one dies, the level resets
- Finish when both step into their exit door

## 🧩 Characters

### 🔵 Character A
Standard movement, direct control. What you press is what you get. Blue.

### 🔴 Character B
Horizontal mirror of A.

Same stats, same jump height, same speed.

## ☠️ Hazards

- **Spikes** instant death on contact
- **Voids** fall off the screen, level resets

---

## 📈 Difficulty Curve

### Level 1 — *Learning to Walk Backwards*
No deadly hazards. Just you and the mirrored controls. The goal is to get comfortable with the mechanic without the pressure of dying.

### Level 2 — *First Blood*
Spikes enter the picture. Basic timing starts to matter. You'll need to sync both characters on a few key moves.

### Level 3 — *Think Before You Step*
Platforms don't line up between zones. Hazards are placed to punish thoughtless movement. Proper planning required.

---

## 🏁 Win & Lose

**You win** when both characters reach their doors.

**You lose** when either one hits a spike or falls. The level restarts immediately, no cutscene, no delay, just reset and try again.

## 🎨 Visual Style

Clean and minimal. The two characters are the visual centerpiece, blue and pink against a neutral background.
